# Sanza's JAVA Object-Oriented Programming Courseworks

This repository contains my coursework for the **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course. It includes solutions to various assignments, each focused on different aspects of OOP in Java.

## Assignment 1: Basic Java OOP Problems

This is the first assignment, which covers basic problems related to Java OOP concepts. The assignment consists of 8 tasks that help practice core Java OOP principles, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

### Tasks:
1. [Task 1 Java program to test object manipulation by creating two University objects, printing their memory locations and instance variables, modifying their values, and comparing the changes.]
2. [Task 2 Java program to design a Student class where the StudentTester1 class demonstrates the usage of instance variables by printing default and modified values of the student's name and ID.]
3. [Task 3 Java program to design a CSECourse class where the CourseTester class demonstrates the use of instance variables to print the course name, code, and credit for a course]
4. [Task 4 "Java program to design an ImaginaryNumber class where the Tester6 class demonstrates the creation and modification of imaginary numbers, printing their real and imaginary parts before and after modification."]
5. [Task 5 "Java program to design a Course class where the Tester5 class demonstrates the updating and displaying of course details using methods to modify and print the course name, code, and credit."]
6. [Task 6 "Java program to design an Assignment class where the AssignmentTester class demonstrates the creation, modification, and printing of assignment details, including methods to update the assignment's properties and check its submission status."]
7. [Task 7 "Java program to design a CellPhone class where the Tester9 class demonstrates storing and displaying contacts on a cellphone. The program includes functionality for adding contacts and checking the limit for storing contacts."]
8. [Task 8 "Design a Java Employee class to handle employee details including name, salary, designation, and tax calculation. The program includes functionality to assign employees, calculate tax based on salary, and promote employees to senior, lead, and manager positions with corresponding salary increments."]

## How to Run
1. Download the files from this repository.
2. Open the `.java` files in any text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
3. Compile and run the Java files to see the output of each task.

## Notes
- The purpose of this assignment was to reinforce key Java OOP concepts through hands-on coding.
